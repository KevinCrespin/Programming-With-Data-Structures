One door making, As times have changed, the demands of the marketplace on our company have increased markedly. We recognize that competitors operating at world-class levels of performance - in quality, cycle time, cost efficiencies, and new product development - are a likely part of our future. We are now better able to understand the importance of our customers' needs, and quality has a new meaning. To become a world-class company will demand flexibility, teamwork, competencies, and focused improvements that we would have found nearly inconceivable a few years ago; and it won't be possible without the full involvement and engagement of every person in the company. World-class companies have recognized that effective leadership and management of people is absolutely critical to achieve the high levels of quality and customer satisfaction they need to compete in today's market. A company's employees are viewed as a valuable source of competitive advantage, and managers assume responsibility for designing optimal structures, systems, and practices. The following human resource policies are practiced by world-class companies: People are strategically important to the company's competitiveness. A work environment based on a set of shared values is a key element to improving quality, innovation, and productivity. Integrity is fundamental. People have a shared destiny with the company.
